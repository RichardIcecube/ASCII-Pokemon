# ASCII-Pokemon
An ASCII-based Pokemon game implemented for COM S 327: Advanced Programming Techniques. This project was coded in and for Linux. Through development of this game, we were expected to accomplish a handful of tasks 
using techniques we dicussed during lectures. <br />
Techniques we implemented included: <br />
* Implementing Djikstra's Algorithm for the path-finding of the AI (depicted as the white letters on the map)
* Allocating and deallocating large chunks of memory to manage a 200x200 world grid map, the player's party of Pokemon, and the items the player carries 
* Reading data from large CSV files to accurately load Pokemons' movesets, stats, types, and names
* Fundamental concepts of C and C++ such as memory management, pointers, function pointers, and various techniques to reduce repetition in code.
